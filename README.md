# authenticgraceboutique

An MVP for a fictional women's clothing boutique that sells clothes and accessories online.

This project was done as part of Moms Can Code: Develop Camp. This is version 2, version 1 can be found here: https://samcarlin.github.io/authenticgrace/index.html

This version displays the landing page for the site and has 2 clickable links. The first is the banner image which takes you directly to a product. The second is the "clothes" link which takes you to the "all clothes" page. On that page, the fist dress is clickable leading to a product page.

The purpose of this project was to practice making an MVP for a client and to link pages together.

#Improvement

Future plans of improvement are: 1. finish adding responsiveness to site, focusing mainly on header and footer. 2. Add a place for customers to be able to leave a product review. 3. Ensure site passes accessibility tests using WAVE.

#Contributors

This version of my project is my own work, but it is based off an earlier version built in collaboration with Melissa McMahon and Almarose Revives.
