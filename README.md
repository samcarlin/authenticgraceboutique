# authenticgraceboutique

An MVP for a fictitional women's clothing boutique that sells clothes and accessories online.

This project was done as part of Moms Can Code: Develop Camp. This is version 2, version 1 can be found here: https://samcarlin.github.io/authenticgrace/index.html

This version displays the landing page for the site and has 2 clickable links. The first is the banner image which takes you directly to a product. The second is the "clothes" link which also takes you directly to a product. I'm hoping to add a "clothes" page at a later date. 

The purpose of this project was to practice making an MVP for a client, to link pages together and to practice using Node.
